Fitness Tracker AI - Current Capabilities Report

  This report details the current functionalities implemented in both the
  frontend and backend of your Fitness Tracker AI project.

  Frontend Capabilities (/frontend)

   * Core Framework & Styling:
       * Built with React.
       * Styled using Bootstrap CSS, providing a responsive and modern UI.
          Redundant navigation buttons have been removed for a streamlined
          user experience.
   * User Authentication:
       * Provides dedicated Login (Login.tsx) and Register (Register.tsx)
         pages for user authentication.
       * Handles user sessions and authentication status, likely
         leveraging localStorage for JWT tokens.
   * Navigation & Layout:
       * A persistent Navbar (Navbar.tsx) is present, dynamically
         adjusting navigation links based on user authentication status
         (Login/Register vs. Exercises/Logout).
       * Routing is managed by react-router-dom, with App.tsx defining the
          main application routes, including protected routes for
         authenticated users.
   * Exercise Management & Tracking:
       * Exercise Selection Page (ExerciseSelection.tsx): Allows
         authenticated users to view a list of available exercises fetched
          from the backend. Each exercise is displayed with its name,
         description, and difficulty, and links to a dedicated workout
         page.
       * Workout Page (WorkoutPage.tsx): This is the core page for
         performing exercises, styled with WorkoutPage.css. It is designed to integrate with MediaPipe
         for real-time pose detection during workouts.
   * UI/UX Components for Workout:
       * TimerOverlay.tsx: A component to display a timer during the workout.
       * CountdownOverlay.tsx: Displays a countdown before the exercise starts.
       * ExerciseInfoOverlay.tsx: Shows information about the current exercise.
       * WorkoutReport.tsx: Displays a summary after the workout is complete.
       * CameraPlaceholder.tsx: A placeholder for the camera feed used in pose detection.
   * Pose Detection:
       * MediaPipe Integration: The frontend has integrated MediaPipe for
         advanced pose detection capabilities, crucial for tracking
         exercise form and progress. This functionality is likely utilized
          within WorkoutPage.tsx and supported by poseUtils.ts.
   * API Communication:
       * A utility file (api.ts) is set up to handle communication with
         the backend API, centralizing HTTP requests.

  Backend Capabilities (/backend)

   * Core Framework & Database:
       * Built with Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust RESTful
         API.
       * Utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary database, configured via
         config/database.ts.
   * User Management & Authentication:
       * User Model: A User.ts model defines the structure for user data.
       * Authentication Routes: authRoutes.ts handles user registration
         and login, implementing JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure
         authentication.
       * Authentication Middleware: middleware/auth.ts provides middleware
          for protecting API routes, ensuring only authenticated users can
          access certain resources.
   * API Endpoints:
       * Authentication Endpoints: Routes for user registration and login.
       * Exercise Endpoints: exercisesRoutes.ts is in place to manage
         exercise data, allowing the frontend to fetch exercise lists. The
          Exercise.ts model defines the structure for exercise data,
         including checkpoints for pose detection.
       * Session Endpoints: sessions.ts and Session.ts indicate the
         presence of API routes and a model for managing workout sessions,
          likely for saving workout history and progress.

  In summary, the project has a solid foundation with complete user
  authentication, a structured frontend for exercise selection and
  workout execution with integrated pose detection, and a backend
  capable of managing users, exercises, and workout sessions.
